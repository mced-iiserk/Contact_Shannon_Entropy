# Contact_Shannon_Entropy
Computes Shannon Entropy of Contact Diversities

This respository contains a Python script for computing the entropy of H-bond reorganisation.

matrices of protein-ligand Hbond time series were generated using CPPTRAJ output files

Matrices were utilised to calculate Shannon entropy at each temperature. A sample *.npz file with matrices at two different temperatures has been provided

- Prerequisite: Python and CPPTRAJ

- Command to run the script: python Shannon_Entro-pnpg.py
